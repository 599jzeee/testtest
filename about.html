    <p>
      With my background in Human-Computer Interaction, I strive to design for the users of my product with empathy. I love to solve problems that are deeply rooted in the users with clear goals through research findings, quantitative data and my intuition as a passionate designer. I am interested in solving difficult problems, envisioning the role of new technologies in the future of people's lives and finding new solutions to design inclusive and accessible products & experiences.
      DM if you want to learn more about me!
